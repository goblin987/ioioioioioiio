## Latest Fixes

### Fix #1: Daily Rewards Button Missing from UI Editor (Commit c7171f9)
- ✅ **FOUND THE ISSUE**: Daily Rewards was NOT in the UI editor's available buttons list
- ✅ Added to `AVAILABLE_BUTTONS['start_menu']` in marketing_promotions.py (line 4369)
- ✅ Now appears in "EDITING: Start Menu" → "Available Buttons" section
- ✅ Can be dragged and placed in custom layouts

### Fix #2: Auto-Activate Custom Theme After Saving (Commit 66fadfa)
- ✅ **ISSUE**: After creating/editing custom UI, admin had to manually activate it
- ✅ **FIX**: Added auto-activation after saving (lines 5289-5291):
  - Deactivates all preset themes: `UPDATE ui_themes SET is_active = FALSE`
  - Activates the saved custom menu: `UPDATE bot_menu_layouts SET is_active = TRUE`
- ✅ Admin now sees their new theme immediately on `/start`
- ✅ Notification changed from "saved successfully" to "saved and activated!"

### Fix #3: Daily Rewards Button Callback "Unknown Action" (Commit ad4927f)
- ✅ **ROOT CAUSE**: Button text "🎁 Daily Rewards" was not mapped to callback handler
- ✅ **SYMPTOM**: Logs showed "No async handler function found or mapped for callback command: noop"
- ✅ **FIX**: Added callback mapping in `map_button_text_to_callback()` (line 1861):
  - `'🎁 Daily Rewards': 'daily_rewards_menu'`
- ✅ Also added to translation map (line 1803) for multi-language support
- ✅ Button now correctly triggers `handle_daily_rewards_menu` handler
