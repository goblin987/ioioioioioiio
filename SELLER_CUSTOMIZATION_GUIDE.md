## 🔄 How the Rolling Calendar Works

### For New Users (Days 1-7):
```
User sees:
📅 7-Day Streak Calendar:
🎯 Day 1: 50 pts ⬅️ Claim Now!
⬜ Day 2: 15 pts
⬜ Day 3: 25 pts
⬜ Day 4: 40 pts
⬜ Day 5: 60 pts
⬜ Day 6: 90 pts

✅ Day 3: 25 pts (claimed)
✅ Day 4: 40 pts (claimed)
✅ Day 5: 60 pts (claimed)
✅ Day 6: 90 pts (claimed)
✅ Day 7: 150 pts (claimed)
🎯 Day 8: 75 pts ⬅️ Claim Now!
```

**Notice:**
- Day 1 is no longer visible (rolled off)
- Always shows **last 6 days + next day**
- Users see their progress, not just Day 1-7

---

## 📊 Automatic Progressive Rewards

### How It Works:
After Day 7, the system automatically calculates rewards for Days 8+:

**Formula:**
```
Day 8-14 = Original reward × 1.5
Day 15-21 = Original reward × 2.0
Day 22-28 = Original reward × 2.5
...and so on
```

**Example:**
```
Day 1: 100 pts (you set this)
Day 8: 150 pts (100 × 1.5, automatic)
Day 15: 200 pts (100 × 2.0, automatic)
Day 22: 250 pts (100 × 2.5, automatic)
```

**Why this is great:**
- ✅ Rewards loyal users automatically
- ✅ No need to manually create 100+ days
- ✅ Keeps users engaged long-term

## 🚀 Best Practices

### ✅ DO:
- Start with smaller rewards (Day 1-3)
- Build excitement with bigger rewards (Day 5-7)
- Make Day 7 a "jackpot" (2-3x Day 6)
- Test different patterns and see what works
- Adjust based on user behavior

### ❌ DON'T:
- Make Day 1 too high (users won't come back)
- Make rewards too similar (boring)
- Forget to add more days (stop at Day 7)
- Set rewards too low (not motivating)

---

## 📈 Tracking Success

### Monitor These Metrics:
1. **Daily Active Users** (DAU)
   - How many users claim rewards daily?
   
2. **Retention Rate**
   - How many users reach Day 7?
   - How many reach Day 14, 21, 30?
   
3. **Average Streak**
   - What's the typical streak length?
   
4. **Points Redeemed**
   - Are users spending points on cases?

### Adjust Based on Data:
- **Low Day 7 completion?** → Increase Day 1-6 rewards
- **High Day 7, low Day 8?** → Make Day 8 more exciting
- **Users hoarding points?** → Create better case rewards
- **Low engagement?** → Add jackpot days (e.g., Day 3, Day 10)

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "I can't see the Manage Reward Schedule button"
**Solution:** Make sure you're logged in as admin (primary admin user)

### "Changes aren't showing for users"
**Solution:** Users need to click "🎁 Daily Rewards" again to see updates

### "I want to reset a user's streak"
**Solution:** Use SQL or contact developer (advanced feature)

### "Can I have different schedules for different users?"
**Solution:** Not currently supported (all users see same schedule)
