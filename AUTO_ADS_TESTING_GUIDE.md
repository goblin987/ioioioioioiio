üßπ BumpService cleaned up
```

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "TelethonManager not initialized"
**Solution:** Make sure TelethonManager is passed to BumpService during initialization

### Issue: "No client found for account X"
**Solution:** 
- Check account has valid `api_id`, `api_hash`, and `session_string`
- Check account `is_active = TRUE`
- Try manual account reload

### Issue: Campaigns not executing
**Solution:**
- Check scheduler is running (look for "üöÄ BumpService scheduler started" in logs)
- Check campaign `is_active = TRUE`
- Check schedule_time or interval_minutes set correctly
- Verify database query in scheduler_loop

### Issue: "Session expired" or "Not authorized"
**Solution:**
- Re-login to account (delete and re-add)
- Generate new session string
- Check API credentials are correct

### Issue: Rate limit errors
**Solution:**
- Reduce campaign frequency
- Add delay between campaigns (already has 2s delay)
- Use different accounts for different channels

---

## Performance Testing

### Test High Volume:
1. Create 10+ campaigns
2. Set all to execute within 5 minutes
3. Monitor execution

**Expected:**
- All campaigns execute
- 2-second delay between each
- No crashes or data loss

### Test Long Running:
1. Create recurring campaign (every 10 minutes)
2. Let run for 24 hours
3. Check stability

**Expected:**
- Consistent execution
- No memory leaks
- Stats accurate

## Next Steps After Testing

If all tests pass:
1. ‚úÖ Mark implementation as complete
2. üìù Document any custom configurations needed
3. üöÄ Deploy to production
4. üìä Monitor logs and performance
5. üîß Adjust intervals/delays as needed

If tests fail:
1. üìã Note which test failed
2. üîç Check error logs
3. üêõ Debug specific component
4. üîÑ Re-test after fix

---

## Support & Debugging

### Enable Debug Logging:
```python
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

### Useful Queries:
```sql
-- All active campaigns due now
SELECT * FROM auto_ads_campaigns
WHERE is_active = TRUE
AND (schedule_time <= NOW() OR interval_minutes IS NOT NULL);

-- Campaign execution history
SELECT id, name, sent_count, last_sent,
       NOW() - last_sent as time_since_last
FROM auto_ads_campaigns
ORDER BY last_sent DESC;

-- Accounts with clients loaded
SELECT a.*, 
       CASE WHEN session_string IS NOT NULL THEN 'YES' ELSE 'NO' END as has_session
FROM auto_ads_accounts a
WHERE is_active = TRUE;
```

**Good luck with testing! üöÄ**
