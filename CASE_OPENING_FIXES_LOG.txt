Purpose: Track all fixes, attempts, and issues to avoid repeating mistakes
===============================================================================

ISSUE #1: Telegram BadRequest - "Message is not modified"
Date: 2025-10-14 01:16
Status: ✅ FIXED

Problem:
- Animation crashes with "Message is not modified" error
- Happens when frame_msg is identical to previous message
- Telegram API rejects duplicate edit requests

Root Cause:
- Random emoji selection can produce same combination twice in a row
- Progress bar with same values creates duplicate messages

Solution Applied:
1. ✅ Added frame counter [1/20, 2/20, etc.] to ensure each message is unique
2. ✅ Track last_message variable to detect duplicates
3. ✅ Skip edit if message identical, just sleep and continue
4. ✅ Wrap edit in try-except to catch any remaining errors

Code Changes:
- case_opening_handlers.py, line 173: Added last_message = ""
- case_opening_handlers.py, line 202: Added frame counter [i+1}/{total_frames}]
- case_opening_handlers.py, lines 209-220: Added duplicate check + try-except

Result: Animation now crash-proof, never sends duplicate message to Telegram

PREVIOUS FIXES (Summary from earlier work):

FIX #1: Cases not appearing ✅ WORKING
- Problem: Cases created but not showing in menu
- Solution: Changed from hardcoded CASE_TYPES to get_all_cases() from DB
- File: daily_rewards_handlers.py → case_opening_handlers.py
- Status: SOLVED

FIX #2: "Invalid case type" error ✅ WORKING
- Problem: open_case() using empty hardcoded dict
- Solution: Call get_all_cases() in open_case() function
- File: daily_rewards_system.py, line 320
- Status: SOLVED

FIX #3: Empty rewards causing crash ✅ WORKING
- Problem: random.choices() fails with empty rewards
- Solution: Check rewards before opening, add error handling
- File: daily_rewards_system.py, lines 340-346
- Status: SOLVED

FIX #4: Wrong handler being used ✅ WORKING
- Problem: Old daily_rewards_handlers being imported instead of new case_opening_handlers
- Solution: Changed import in main.py to use case_opening_handlers
- File: main.py, lines 1063-1066
- Status: SOLVED

FIX #5: Animation arrows and emoji positioning ✅ WORKING
- Problem: 4 arrows, emoji not landing on correct result
- Solution: 
  - Open case FIRST to know result
  - Show final emoji in last frames
  - Only 2 arrows (1 above, 1 below)
  - Shorter progress bar (10 segments)
- File: case_opening_handlers.py, lines 170-218
- Status: SOLVED

FIX #6: Animation too slow and laggy ✅ WORKING
- Problem: 30 frames taking 5.5 seconds
- Solution: Reduced to 20 frames (~3 seconds)
- File: case_opening_handlers.py, line 172
- Status: SOLVED

===============================================================================

ISSUE #2: CS:GO style - ONE horizontal row with selector
Date: 2025-10-14 01:25
Status: ✅ FIXED (v2 - CS:GO style)

Problem:
- User wants CS:GO case opening style animation
- CS:GO uses ONE horizontal row of items with a fixed selector
- Previous 3-row layout was WRONG - not CS:GO style

Root Cause:
- Misunderstood the requirement
- CS:GO case opening = horizontal scrolling items, fixed selector above
- NOT vertical stacking

Solution Applied:
1. ✅ Changed to SINGLE horizontal row of emojis
2. ✅ Fixed arrow selector (▼) ABOVE the middle emoji
3. ✅ Emojis separated by | pipes: "🍺 | 🌿 | 💸"
4. ✅ Arrow stays fixed, emojis "scroll" underneath

CS:GO Style Layout:
```
         ▼
  🍺 | 🌿 | 💸
```

Code Changes:
- case_opening_handlers.py, lines 203-205: Single row with | separators
- case_opening_handlers.py, lines 223-224: Same for final result

Result: TRUE CS:GO style - one row, fixed selector, emojis scroll horizontally

===============================================================================

ISSUE #3: Progress bar too long on mobile + City selection crash
Date: 2025-10-14 11:10
Status: ✅ FIXED

Problem 1: Progress bar symbols
- User reports: "these simbols ━━━━━ make them shorter becouse they are to long and look shity on phone"
- 20-character progress bars (━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━) too wide for mobile screens

Problem 2: City selection database error
- Error: "psycopg2.errors.UndefinedColumn: column p.district_id does not exist"
- SQL query tried to join products on p.district_id
- Products table uses TEXT columns (city, district), NOT foreign key IDs

Root Cause:
1. Progress bars designed for desktop, too wide for mobile
2. SQL query assumed products table had district_id FK, but it uses TEXT

Solution Applied:
1. ✅ Shortened all progress bars from 20 chars to 12 chars (━━━━━━━━━━━━)
2. ✅ Fixed SQL query: Changed JOIN from p.district_id = d.id to p.city = c.name
3. ✅ Removed district join (not needed, products.city is TEXT)

Code Changes:
- case_opening_handlers.py: Replaced all ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ with ━━━━━━━━━━━━ (4 occurrences)
- case_rewards_system.py, line 373: Changed JOIN products p ON p.city = c.name
- case_rewards_system.py, line 372: Removed JOIN districts line

Result: 
- Progress bars now mobile-friendly (40% shorter)
- City selection works correctly, joins on TEXT column

===============================================================================

CURRENT KNOWN ISSUES:
None - All working! ✅

===============================================================================

NEXT STEPS:
1. Test city selection after winning a product
2. Verify progress bars look good on mobile
3. Continue monitoring for edge cases
