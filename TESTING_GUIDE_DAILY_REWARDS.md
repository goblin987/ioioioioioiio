- ✅ Day 8 reward is 150 pts (Day 1 × 1.5)

---

**Test Case C: User on Day 15 (Second Cycle)**
```
Simulate: User has claimed Days 1-14, now on Day 15
```

**Expected Result:**
```
📅 Streak Calendar (Days 9-15):
✅ Day 9: 1498 pts (Day 2 × 1.5)
✅ Day 10: 37 pts (Day 3 × 1.5)
✅ Day 11: 60 pts (Day 4 × 1.5)
✅ Day 12: 90 pts (Day 5 × 1.5)
✅ Day 13: 135 pts (Day 6 × 1.5)

🎯 Day 15: 200 pts ⬅️ Claim Now!

🎁 Next Reward: 2247 points (Day 2 of cycle 3)
```

**Progressive Calculation:**
- Day 15 = Day 1 of cycle 3
- Cycle 3 multiplier = 1 + (2 × 0.5) = 2.0
- Day 15 reward = 100 × 2.0 = 200 pts ✅

### 3️⃣ **Test Database Integrity**

**SQL Queries to Verify:**

```sql
-- Check reward schedule
SELECT * FROM daily_reward_schedule ORDER BY day_number;

-- Check user logins
SELECT user_id, login_date, streak_count, points_awarded, claimed 
FROM daily_logins 
WHERE user_id = YOUR_USER_ID 
ORDER BY login_date DESC;

-- Check user points
SELECT * FROM user_points WHERE user_id = YOUR_USER_ID;
```

**Expected:**
- `daily_reward_schedule`: Shows all days with correct points
- `daily_logins`: Shows user's claim history
- `user_points`: Shows accumulated points

---

### 4️⃣ **Test Edge Cases**

**Edge Case 1: Streak Break**
```
1. User claims Day 1
2. Wait 2+ days (don't claim)
3. Return and click Daily Rewards
```

**Expected:**
```
😢 Your streak was broken. Starting fresh!

🔥 Current Streak: 1 day(s)
...
📅 7-Day Streak Calendar:
🎯 Day 1: 100 pts ⬅️ Claim Now!
...
```

---

**Edge Case 2: Already Claimed Today**
```
1. User claims reward
2. Immediately click Daily Rewards again
```

**Expected:**
```
🔥 Current Streak: 1 day(s)
...
✅ Day 1: 100 pts (claimed)

[💎 Open Cases]  ← No "Claim" button
```

---

**Edge Case 3: Custom Amount = 0 or Negative**
```
Admin tries to set Day 1 = 0 or -10
```

**Expected:**
```
❌ Points must be greater than 0.
Try again:
```

    5: 60,
    6: 90,
    7: 150
}
# Fixed, no customization
# Max 7 days, then resets
```

### AFTER (Database-Driven):
```python
# Admin can edit via UI
# Infinite days supported
# Progressive rewards auto-calculated
# Rolling calendar shows relevant days
```
